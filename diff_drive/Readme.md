# Diff robot

This package contains a lot of different sub-projects that lead to the creation of the final one....

## The src directory

### The .sdf file
For the story: as I was having issues making everything things works, I first created everything in an .sdf file.

```bash
$ cd ackerman/diff_drive
$ colcon build
$ . install/setup.bash
$ gz sim src/simple_robot_model.sdf 
```
### src/vehicule.urdf and src/vehicle.xacro

Both are the same, the urdf file is juste the calculate version of the vehicle.xacro file. I was using them trying to divide the robot from the sdf.



## The model directory

In this directory, you can find all robots that works.

The two_wheels.xacro file contains the robot with 2 wheels and a caster wheel.

The four_wheels.xacro file contains the cousin of the two_wheels robot. It contains 4 wheels. To solve the issue of the two front ones stopping the movement, I put their friction at 0.

#### Run

Put the wanted file in the display.launch.py then

```bash
$ cd ackerman/diff_drive
$ colcon build
$ . install/setup.bash
$  ros2 launch diff_drive vehicule.launch.py 
```

To make the robot move add the KeyPublisher plugin the the top right corner. For more information go to the my_robot_description package.
